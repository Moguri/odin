Gameplay Description
====================

Overview
--------

The game will be broken up into three game modes:

#. Assignment: A single battle
#. Exam: A set of three battles (two normal and a "miniboss")
#. Final: A set of nine battles broken down as follows:

   #. Regular Battle
   #. Regular Battle
   #. Regular Battle
   #. Miniboss (Checkpoint)
   #. Regular Battle
   #. Regular Battle
   #. Regular Battle
   #. Miniboss (Checkpoint)
   #. Boss

   After a checkpoint battle, the player can exit the exam and return to it later.
   Likewise, if a player loses a battle in the final, they can continue from their last checkpoint.

The goal of the game is to get strong enough from assignments and exams to defeat the final.
To get stronger, players can gain levels and equipment.
